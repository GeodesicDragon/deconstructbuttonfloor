	<description>Usually when you want to deconstruct old buildings and floors you would need to go to Floors > Remove Floor and then switch to another category which had a Deconstruct button in order to remove the rest of the structure.
	
Not any more; this mod contains a patch which adds a 'Deconstruct' button to the 'Floor' category in the Architect menu, removing the need to switch categories every few seconds.</description>
